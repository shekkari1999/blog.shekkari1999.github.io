# 🚀 Linformer: The Efficient Transformer You Need to Know  

## 🔍 Why Do We Need Linformer?  

Traditional Transformers **struggle with scaling** because **self-attention requires O(n²) computation**.  
Linformer **solves this by reducing attention complexity to O(n), making it significantly more efficient**.

> *"Linformer brings us closer to real-time, large-scale Transformers."*

## 🔬 How Does Linformer Work?  

Linformer **modifies self-attention by projecting Key & Value matrices into a lower-dimensional space (Nxk instead of NxN).**  

### 📊 Key Differences: Linformer vs. Standard Transformer  
| Feature           | Transformer (Vanilla) | Linformer |
|------------------|--------------------|------------|
| **Complexity**  | O(n²)              | O(n) |
| **Memory Usage** | High               | Low |
| **Ideal For**   | Short Sequences    | Long Sequences |
| **Performance** | Slow on large data | Faster & scalable |

📌 **In simple terms:** Linformer **compresses attention computation while maintaining high accuracy**.

## 🛠 Code Implementation in PyTorch  

Below is a **quick PyTorch implementation of Linformer**:

```python
from linformer import Linformer
import torch
from torch import nn

# Define Linformer Model
linformer = Linformer(
    dim=512, seq_len=4096, depth=6, heads=8, k=256
)

# Dummy input
x = torch.randn(1, 4096, 512)
output = linformer(x)
print(output.shape)  # Expected output: (1, 4096, 512)
